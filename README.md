Members Area
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjie/members-area.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benjie/members-area)

This is a free and open source Members Area specifically targeted at
Makerspaces/Hackspaces/Hackerspaces though also suitable for other
community groups.

It's a ground-up rewrite of the original [So Make It][] Members Area.

Project status
--------------

Work in progress, getting there.

Getting started
---------------

Heroku instructions coming soon...

Contributing
------------

I've designed the members area to have a plugin architecture allowing
for easy expansion. In fact many of the features that could have been
core are implemented as plugins. You can easily contribute to the
ecosystem by making a plugin to expand the functionality of the members
area.

I want to keep the core pretty tight, simple and reliable; improvements
to performance, security and other fixes are welcome, as are additional
plugin hooks if well thought out, but if you plan on adding more
functionality to core it may be worth having a chat first :)

Bootstrap
---------

I'm no designer, so I use [Bootstrap 2.3.2][], if you wish to
contribute, the documentation can be found there.
